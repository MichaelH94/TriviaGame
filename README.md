Trivia Game for KU Coding Bootcamp

Made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Utilizes Bootstrap and JQuery. 

Simple trivia game with 15 questions. You've got 15 seconds to select an answer. If time runs out, it's counted as a wrong guess. After 15 questions, the game ends. The only player input is the start button and the selecting of answers. All questions are handled through timers and require no action on the player's part. The rest of the code utilizes objects for easier organization, as well as separate functions for every action taken.
